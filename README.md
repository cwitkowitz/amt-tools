# Automatic Music Transcription Tools
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a one-stop-shop for machine learning related approaches to music transcription.

The models and datasets are written in PyTorch.

Inspiration for this work came mostly from https://github.com/jongwook/onsets-and-frames, but also from my own research needs.

For now, the models and datasets are based on single-instrument transcription.

This is a HUGE work-in-progress. I have big plans, but my ground-up approach means that this repository will remain hacky for some time.
