def file_sort(file_name):

    Augment file names for sorting within the models directory. Since, e.g.,
    /'500/' will by default be scored as higher than /'1500/'. One way to fix
    this is by adding the length of the file to the beginning of the string.

    Parameters
    ----------

      Path being sorted
